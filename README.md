# tic-tac-toe-game
A modular, object-oriented Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java using a clean package structure. The game is played in the console and supports two players.

🧾 Project Description
This is a console-based Java application of the classic Tic Tac Toe (X-O) game. It follows a well-organized package structure using object-oriented principles and includes exception handling for invalid inputs.

The goal is to provide a structured, extensible, and beginner-friendly codebase that can serve as both a learning tool and a game demo.

 Gameplay Overview
Players X and O alternate turns.

The first to align 3 symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

If all 9 cells are filled with no winner, the game ends in a draw.

Invalid inputs (e.g., choosing an occupied cell) throw meaningful exceptions and prompt again.
